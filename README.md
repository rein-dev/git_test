Learning with TheOdinProject
Hello Odin!

It was a long process. I first set up a bootable usb, partitioned the hard drive, but struggled when booting into Linux to get my wifi working. I figured its because Windows was the primary user of the wifi card. Thats when I decided to go full blown Linux OS and haven't looked back since. I have git set up and work from my local machine and commit straight to github through the terminal. I understand now what github is used for and how to use it correctly. There's still plenty to learn about github, but I enjoy it.
